Project #1: The Game - [Working Title - Meatball Monster]

https://trello.com/b/tq4uG30T/project-1

Game outline 

	Objective of the game is for the player to move the bun (object in which you are "catching") left or right on the board to catch meatballs that decend from the sky. Once the player catches three meatballs in the bun, they win. There will also be rocks decending from the sky. If the player catches a rock on the first try, the game ends, and the player looses immediately. If the player catches any rocks after catching a meatball - it makes the meatball disappear. 
User view 

	Player will hit "start", at which point the game board will render. After 3 seconds, meatballs and rocks will begin decending from the sky. The user will use the A key or the L key to move the bun left or right, respectively. They will move under the meatballs to catch them, and away from the rocks, to avoid them. 

	Features
		There is a START button to begin the game, a PAUSE button to freeze, and a RESET to play again. There will also be a SCORE button to reflect the users score. *Potentially LEVELS - where speed and number of meatballs decending/needed to complete the sandwich will increase*

Language Use
	The game will be created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Scoring
	The user will receive 10 points for every meatball caught and loose 10 points for every rock caught. When the user reaches 30 points (or 3 meatballs) they win!

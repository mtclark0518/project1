Game outline 

	Objective of the game is for the player to move the bun (object in which you are "catching") left or right on the board to catch meatballs that decend from the sky. The timer is set to 60 seconds, and after the user clicks "start", rocks & meatballs begin decending from the sky. The user must catch/gather items by clicking the objects.

User view 

	The player will hit "start", and then meatballs/rocks will begin decending from the sky. The user will use their mouse to move and click objects to "catch" them. Meatballs gain you 1 point, while rocks will cost you a loss of 1 point.Ã¥

	Features
		There is a START button to begin the game and a RESET to play again. There will also be a SCORE button to reflect the users score. The user plays against themselves or friends, with the help of a high score tracker that records the highest score of the game played. 

Language Use
	The game will be created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. CSS styles the landing page and game in terms of color, spacial relationships, and categorizes items into classes. Javascript allows for the functionality of the game - generating the meatball/rocks dropping. 

Scoring
	The user will receive 1 point for every meatball caught and loose 1 point for every rock caught. Whatever user is able to catch the most amount of points in a single round (60 seconds), will have their score saved and be the new high score winner.
